 1. HTML Structure:

*Header: Displays the title “Admin Dashboard” and a checkbox toggle labeled “Dark Mode” for switching themes.
*Sidebar (nav): Vertical navigation menu with links to Home, Users, and Settings.
*Main Content: Contains a welcome message and space to add charts, tables, or reports.
*Footer: Displays a simple copyright notice.
*Tags Used: Semantic HTML tags including `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.

2. CSS Layout & Styling:

*Layout: Utilizes CSS Grid to organize the page into header, sidebar (nav), main content area, and footer sections.
*Styles: Applies background colors, padding, borders, font sizes, and colors to create a clean, readable interface.
*Themes: Defines CSS variables for light mode colors and overrides those variables for dark mode colors using the checkbox toggle.
*Dark Mode: When the checkbox is checked, background and text colors switch to darker tones for comfortable low-light viewing.

 3. Test Cases:

1. On page load, all sections (header, nav, main, footer) display with correct layout and styles.
2. Checking the “Dark Mode” toggle switches colors to dark theme instantly without reload.
3. Unchecking the toggle reverts back to light theme colors.
4. Navigation links remain visible and readable in both modes.
5. Keyboard navigation focuses toggle and links properly for accessibility.
6. CSS variables update dynamically based on toggle state as expected.

* Use **semantic HTML** elements for better structure and accessibility.
* Create page layouts with **CSS Grid** for clean sectioning.
* Use **CSS variables** to easily manage and switch between themes.
