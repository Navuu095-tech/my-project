 1. HTML Structure:

  *Header: A simple <h1> element displays the title:“Live Character Counter”.
  *Main Content:
   - A <textarea> where the user types input text.
   - A <p> element below the textarea shows the current character count dynamically.
  *Tags Used:
   - Semantic structure using elements like <h1>, <textarea>, and <p>.
   - Uses a 'div' container to center and style the form neatly on the page.

 2. CSS Layout & Styling:

  *Layout:
   -The entire interface is wrapped in a centered ".container" div.
   - Max-width and margin are used to make it responsive and centered.

  *Styles:
   - Background color ('White') creates a soft, clean look.
   -Padding, border radius, and box shadow give a card-like layout.
   -Textarea is styled for clarity with consistent font, padding, and resizable vertical input.
   - Character count text is styled with margin and font size for readability.


 3. JavaScript Functionality:

  * Listens for the 'input' event on the '<textarea>'.
  * On every keystroke or deletion:
   - The script calculates the current length of the text.
   - Updates the '<p>' element with the new character count.


 4. Test Cases:
  Test Case             |    Expected Result                                                   
                        | 
  1. Page Load          | Title, textarea, and counter display correctly with clean layout. 
  2. Typing in Textarea | Character counter updates in real time as user types.             
  3. Deleting Text      | Character count decreases immediately with deleted input.         
  4. Blank Input        | Displays "Characters: 0" when no text is present.                 
  5. Responsiveness     | Layout adjusts and remains centered on smaller screen sizes.      
  6. Accessibility      | Textarea is focusable and usable with keyboard navigation.        

 5. Key Learning Points:

  *  Learn how to handle "real-time events" using JavaScript ('input' event).
  *  Understand "DOM manipulation" to update content ('textContent').
  *  Practice "CSS styling" to enhance layout and readability.
  *  Understand how to "structure form interfaces" with HTML.
  *  Reinforce how simple JavaScript can improve user experience dynamically.

 6. Learning Outcomes:
