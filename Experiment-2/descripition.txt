The HTML builds a simple banking UI layout.

It includes a container to center the content.

A balance display shows the current account value.

Two buttons—Deposit and Withdraw—are provided.

The structure uses semantic and clean class names.

CSS centers the layout using Flexbox on the body.

.outer-container and .inner-container define size and background.

.balance is styled with green color and larger font.

Buttons are color-coded (green for deposit, red for withdraw).

The design is clean, modern, and easy to interact with.
